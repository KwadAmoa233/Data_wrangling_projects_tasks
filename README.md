# Data_wrangling_projects_tasks
This repository was created to share some of the projects i did while taking a class in Data Wrangling. Using R and SQL

I give permission for public to access my work.

This repository comes with a number of subdirectories

Project 1: Used some skills learnt in SQL to perform some data wrangling on provided data sets using some commands like alter, set, where,update

Project 2: This is a continuation of the work in SQL where we tried new commands like average and datediff to perfrom some data analysis in SQL

Project 3: Performed some data analysi on datasets using R where i got to practice dplyr and also how to apply textscraping on some websites

Midterm Project: A messy dataset was provided and i was asked to perform some data wrangling in both R an d SQL to transform the data into model ready format for data analysis

Final Project: A dataset was provided and i was required to use my SQL and R skills obtained to transform the data and also to do some analysis. In this project i also practiced how to connect R to a database using ODBC drivers.
